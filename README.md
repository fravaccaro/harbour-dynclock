Your clock icon will show you the current time. Tested on Sailfish OS 1.1.9.28. It may not be compatible with previous releases.

## READ FIRST

1. Install ImageMagick from Warehouse first.
2. Systemd timers are not triggered when Jolla is in deep sleep, so if you take your device after a long inactivity period it may take a while before the calendar is updated (usually a couple of seconds). It's not really my fault, I tried to do the best I could considering my knowledge and current Sailfish OS behaviour, If anybody knows a better implementation, don't hesitate to contact me.

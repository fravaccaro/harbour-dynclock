Your clock icon will show you the current time. Tested on Sailfish OS 2.0. It may not be compatible with previous releases.

## Read first

1. Install ImageMagick from Warehouse first.
2. Systemd timers are not triggered when Jolla is in deep sleep, so if you take your device after a long inactivity period it may take a while before the calendar is updated (usually a couple of seconds). It's not really my fault, I tried to do the best I could considering my knowledge and current Sailfish OS behaviour, If anybody knows a better implementation, don't hesitate to contact me.

For the latest release, go to https://openrepos.net/content/fravaccaro/dynclock-dynamic-clock-icon

## Themes support

DynClock supports theming via [Theme pack support for Sailfish OS](https://fravaccaro.github.io/themepacksupport-sailfishos/docs/getstarted.html).
